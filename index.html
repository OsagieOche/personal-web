          <p>
            I am a Medical Doctor turned Product Manager. My primary interest is
            utilizing technology to better people's lives.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've built products used by thousands in the United Kingdom, Germany
            & Nigeria. To date, my experience has primarily been in health-tech,
            however, I am equally keen on exploring other domains.
          </p>
          <p>
            I currently reside in Waterloo, ON ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ and am currently looking for
            part-time/internship opportunities in Product Management
            (core/growth).
